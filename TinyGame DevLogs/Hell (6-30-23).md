Oh my god I've been working on this one goddamn system for a month lord help me.

### Striking (Grounded)
When the player strikes the ball while grounded, we first take note of their movement direction and distance from the center of the court (the net).

##### Case 1: The player is facing the net
When the player strikes the ball while traveling towards the net *(and is within some short range of it)* the ball will travel over the net by selecting a target position past the net within a certain radius from the player. 

If the player strikes the ball outside of a given range, the ball will just travel upwards.

##### Case 2: The player is facing away from the net
When the player strikes the ball while traveling in directions away from the net, the ball will simply travel upwards in a parabolic motion so that a teammate may recover it or strike it in the air.
