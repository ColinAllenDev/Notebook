#### Interfaces are king
Keep your interface files clean, simple, minimal, easy to understand, and well commented.

#### Good names encourage understanding and avoid confusion
Stick to inituitive names that map directly to the purpose of the class, function or variable in question.

#### Don't clutter the global namespace
Use C++ namespaces or a common naming prefix to ensure that your symbols don't collide with symbols in other libraries. 

#### Be Consistent
When writing a body of code from scratch, feel free to invent any convention you like- then stick to it.

#### Make errors stick out
Write code to make common errors *easier to spot*.
